The countries should be ordered alphabetically.
Command: top_countries <num_countries>

### Bonus

Ship Type
Some ships are Passenger ships, some are Cargo ships, and who knows? There may be more types.
Add a new command ships_by_types that displays how many ships there are from each type.
Search Ship By names
Add a new command search_ship for searching a ship by name. The search should be case insensitive and find by partial name.
For example, if I searched "disney", I should find the ship "DISNEY DREAM".

Add a new command speed_histogram that creates an histogram of the speed of the ships, and save it to a file.
